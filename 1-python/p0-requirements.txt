p0-
write a python application!
    retail store ordering/inventory system
    journal/note taking app
    calculator
    to-do app
    business/account management system
    expense tracking system
    password manager
    bank account manager
    productivity/automation tool
    (very simple) text-based game
    text/sql database parser
    web api client
the app must work with either the file system, or the network, in some way.
    for example, it stores or processes data in files (maybe using pickle format, or some text format like csv)
must be something that you can make a simple crappy version of in a day,
    but you can imagine several directions for improving and extending it.
"how much do i have to implement?" "what are my exact requirements?"
    impress me! and keep pace with your fellow batchmates.
manage the development using git and github.
    make a repository named "<firstname><lastinitial>-project0"
    in the batch organization

recommended:
    have both interactive mode...
        (looking at input() from the user,
        and/or using a package like pynput to read individual key presses directly
        without the user having to press "enter")
        (consider the blessings package for a text-based UI)
    ...and non-interactive mode
        (accepting some command-line arguments using the argparse module, or sys.argv directly,
        to do some operations or outputting without needing the user to type more
        - so it could be used in a automated script
i'll be glad to help guide anybody's brainstorming on features or on implementation details.
